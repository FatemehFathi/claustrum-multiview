# Automatic segmentation of the claustrum using an ensemble of multi-view convolutional neural networks. The framework mainly includes three steps:

a) the pre-processing of the images.  <br />
b) training two single-view convolutional neural networks (U-Net) to segment the claustrum.  <br />
c) ensemble of the results from single views.  <br />
d) simple post-proccesing of the results.
