### This is a tutorial on Automatic Segmentation of the claustrum in MR images using deep learning. 

The process mainly includes four steps:
a) the pre-processing of the images.  <br />
b) training two single-view convolutional neural networks (U-Net) to segment the claustrum.  <br />
c) ensemble of the results from single views.  <br />
d) simple post-proccesing of the results.
