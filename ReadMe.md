# Claustrum segmentation using multi-view networks ensembles

## This is repository of the method to automatically segment the structure of claustrum in the brain. The framework mainly includes three steps:

a) simple pre-processing of the images.
b) training two single-view convolutional neural networks (U-Net) to segment the claustrum. 
c) ensemble of the results from single views.
d) simple post-proccesing of the results.
