data/training/

In this folder you can save your MRI scans for training a model. You can use your own scans or feel free to register for the developing Human Connectome Project (http://www.developingconnectome.org/data-release/second-data-release/information-registration-and-download/) to request data.

Data should be structured in this way:
	sub-ID #one folder for each subject
		*T2w.nii.gz #T2-weighted scan
		*seg*.nii.gz #segmentation
