data/training/mask

In this folder, you can save your masks/segmentations corresponding to MRI scans in data/training/image for training a model. Please regard that images and masks should be in the same order, i. e. the first training image should be related to the first training mask and so on.

When you have filled in some masks you should remove this ReadMe file for training.
